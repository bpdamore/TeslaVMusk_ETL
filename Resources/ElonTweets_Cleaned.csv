516,2018-05-04 00:00:00,13:04:00,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms.

1958,2018-09-20 00:00:00,18:44:00,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
1959,2018-09-20 00:00:00,19:12:00,@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
1960,2018-09-20 00:00:00,18:53:00,"@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
1961,2018-09-20 00:00:00,19:39:00,@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
1962,2018-09-20 00:00:00,19:26:00,"@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
1963,2018-09-20 00:00:00,19:51:00,"@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
1965,2018-09-20 00:00:00,19:52:00,"@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."

6592,2020-02-20 00:00:00,23:24:00,@SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
6593,2020-02-20 00:00:00,23:31:00,@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.

6597,2020-02-20 00:00:00,23:54:00,@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
